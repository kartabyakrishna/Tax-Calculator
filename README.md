## Logic

### Income Tax Calculation
- The income tax is calculated based on predefined slabs:
  - 5% for income between 200,000 and 1,000,000.
  - 10% for income between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000.
  - 15% for income between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000.
  - 20% for income between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000.
  - 25% for income between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000.
  - 30% for income between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000.
  - 35% for income between 7,000,000 and 10,000,000.
  - 40% for income exceeding 10,000,000.

### EMI Calculation
- The EMI is calculated using the formula for Equated Monthly Installment (EMI): 
  `EMI = [P * r * (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]`
  where P is the principal amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of monthly installments.
